<p>My name is Rokesh Arumugam, 15, and I am a self-taught, indie programmer. I first started programming about 3 years ago because a friend at school suggested it to me. I am now confident in 4 programming languages (Java, HTML, CSS and Javascript) and am learning some other languages currently (Swift and Visual Basic).</p>
<p>I have developed a few different products which you can view from the 'Products' tab in the navaigation above. For my products I usually don't develop any sounds myself, but I download them from the internet and edit them to my specifications. Also, I haven't spent any money for my programming so far. I don't use any 'Content Managers' to code either. I type out all my code manually into an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) or a text editor. I would greatly appreciate any feedback via the 'Contact Us' page.</p>
