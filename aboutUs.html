            <p>My name is Rokesh Arumugam, 15, and I am an indie programmer. I first started programming about 3 years ago because a friend at school suggested it to me. I am self-taught but my dad has been a computer programmer for 10 years so he gives me tips. I am now confident in 4 programming languages (Java, HTML, CSS and Javascript) and am learning some other languages currently (Swift and Visual Basic).</p>
            <p>I have developed a few different products which you can view by visiting the 'Products' page. For my products I usually don't develop any sounds myself, but I download them off the internet and edit them to my liking. Also, I haven't spent any money to help my programming in any way - yet. I don't use any 'Content Managers' to code either. I type out all my code manually into an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) or a text editor. I even developed <em>this very website</em> manually! I would greatly appreciate any feedback via the 'Contact Us' page.</p>
